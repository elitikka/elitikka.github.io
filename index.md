## ==Mimmi==

### General information

- **Name:** Mimmi
- **Date of birth:** 20.3.2011
- **Breed:** maatiainen
- **Color:** Bicolor

### Description

Mimmi was originally my older sister's cat. Back then we had one more cat, who has since passed away, and my sister felt lonely living alone and wanted a cat for herself as well. She wanted a cat like we had: someone independent and easy to take care of. When Mimmi arrived, she was nothing like that. Mimmi was very energetic as a kitten and she would seek attention all the time. Mimmi loved to play and she was running and jumping around like a ninja. After a few months my sister gave up and gave Mimmi to me. Mimmi has stayed with me until 2023 when I gave her to mom, to keep her company while she's home taking care of my disabled dad. Mimmi loves it because my mom gives her all her attention. Every evening they get settled on the couch. My mom will be listening to her audio books while Mimmi takes a nap on her lap. During summertime Mimmi loves to go out and my mom takes her out on a walk on leash almost daily.

## ==Nyyti==

### General information

- **Name:** Nyyti
- **Date of birth:** 12.6.2019
- **Breed:** Persian x Scottish Fold
- **Color:** Silver-grey tabby

### Description

Just before Covid hit, I was talking with a friend of mine and she said that her friend has some kittens, and she asked if I would like to go see them. I said "sure". What could go wrong? *Well...* I went to see the kittens and one of them climbed on my lap and fell asleep. At that moment I decided that he will be coming back home with me. And so I bought Nyyti and brought him home. Nyyti has been a troublemaker since day 1. He is very agile, very energetic, and way too smart for his own good. Nyyti is constantly trying to figure out different ways to entertain himself. Only ceiling is the limit for him because sometimes he jumps on top of the doors to keep an eye on the household. Nyyti has a habit of waking me up every morning at 8. It's incredible how the cat's inner clock can be so accurate. There are mornings when I hate it, but most of the time I'm really thankful that I don't need an alarm clock. If Nyyti could code, he'd probably think of the following:


If Nyyti could decide a task list for the day, it could include:
- [x]  Wake up servant at 8 am.
- [x]  Cause mayhem
- [ ]  Investigate kitchen cabinets for extra bits of food
- [ ]  Nap
- [ ]  Ninja training practice

![Bemme the cat](/pictures/bemme_lookup.png)

## ==Bemme==

### General information

- **Name:** Benjamin "Bemme"
- **Date of birth:** 6.3.2014
- **Breed:** maatiainen
- **Color:** Chocolate tabby mitted

### Description

My friend was setting up breeding paperwork and everything, but before she was able to finish everything related to bureocracy, an accident happened and then Bemme was born. Bemme was one of the three kittens. Bemme has always been really sweet. He's a real angel. There are a lot of memes on the internet explaining how every two cat household has two cats: one sweet angel and one crazy devil. I'd say that this is accurate in my household and Bemme would be the angel one. Bemme is really careful to never hurt anyone. He is big, heavy and a bit clumsy. Bemme spends most of his days sleeping on the table while I'm on PC next to him. When I go to sleep, he'll follow me to bed. Bemme loves being brushed and if he could choose, he would get my attention and love all day long. Sometimes Bemme spots the mouse cursor on my monitor and tries to eat it.
